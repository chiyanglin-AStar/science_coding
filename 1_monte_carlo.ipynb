        "Monte Carlo Simulation is a statistical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the presence of random variables. It relies on the generation of random samples to obtain numerical results and is named after the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, as the method involves randomness and chance, much like games of chance at a casino.\n",

It provides a powerful tool for decision-making and risk analysis by allowing analysts to model complex systems and assess the likelihood of different scenarios. The more simulations conducted, the more accurate and reliable the results become."

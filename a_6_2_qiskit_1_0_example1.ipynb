The power of quantum computing cannot be simulated on classical computers and you need to use real quantum hardware to scale to larger quantum circuits. However, running a quantum circuit on hardware requires rewriting to the basis gates and connectivity of the quantum hardware. The tool that does this is the transpiler, and Qiskit includes transpiler passes for synthesis, optimization, mapping, and scheduling. However, it also includes a default compiler, which works very well in most examples.

        "Qiskit provides an abstraction layer that lets users run quantum circuits on hardware from any vendor that provides a compatible interface. The best way to use Qiskit is with a runtime environment that provides optimized implementations of sampler and estimator for a given hardware platform. This runtime may involve using pre- and post-processing, such as optimized transpiler passes with error suppression, error mitigation, and, eventually, error correction built in. A runtime implements qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler and qiskit.primitives.BaseEstimator interfaces. For example, some packages that provide implementations of a runtime primitive implementation are:\n",

        "Qiskit also provides a lower-level abstract interface for describing quantum backends. This interface, located in qiskit.providers, defines an abstract BackendV2 class that providers can implement to represent their hardware or simulators to Qiskit. The backend class includes a common interface for executing circuits on the backends; however, in this interface each provider may perform different types of pre- and post-processing and return outcomes that are vendor-defined. Some examples of published provider packages that interface with real hardware are:\n",

The hydrogen atom is a single electron in the Coulomb field of a proton, which makes it a great example to demonstrate quantum mechanical simulation methods.\n",

We can explore the **ground-state** properties and **time evolution** of the electron in the hydrogen atom potential, $V(r) = -\\frac{e^2}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0 r}$, where $e$ is the electron charge, $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity, and $r$ is the distance from the nucleus.\n",
